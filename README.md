## Viscosity and Drain Time Calculator

Simply input either a drain time or viscosity into one of the given input fields and then select the type of viscosity cup you are working with to calculate the viscosity or drain time of your sample.

If the selected cup is highlighted in green that means you are within the cups viscosity range and the number is valid. If you are outside of the cups range an error message will appear, meaning you are outside the tolerance range of that given cup. If this appears please use a different size cup that would be in range for what you would like to test.

You can see what cups are in range for your desired value by inputting the value you want to test and scrolling through the list, any cup in green will be able to provide a valid measurement for the desired input.
